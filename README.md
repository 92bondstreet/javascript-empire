## 🎯 Objective

```
Be able to start an online business with a web application.
```

## 🎣 Philosophy and Methodology

The idea of this course is **to embark you on the entrepreneurial journey to build your own web application to solve a real-world problem**.

I follow the **Industry best practices** with a 3-months-path with **1 dedicated theme by month**:

1. 🏁 **Theme 1 - Javascript World Domination**. How JavaScript is eating the world.
2. 🏗 **Theme 2 - Node.js, Master of Universe**. How we can build a client and server application with the same language.
3. 📡 **Theme 3 - Data is the new Gold**. How to control your data to control your business.

For each theme, I share a **collection of useful links** to deep diving in 3 parts:

* **📖 Must Read** - Useful links **to read as blog post** or github link.
* **🍿 Must Watch** - At least 1 talk or podcast link could help you **to learn in a passive or active context** (commuting, workout...).
* **👩🏽‍💻 Just tell me what to do** - **To be ready** for the month of the workshop days: links to tutorials to do, stuff to install...
* **The 🚀 link**. If you have just 30 minutes in your student busy life: **Read the 🚀 link**

I try to reach 14 hours of work by week (2h by day, Monday to Sunday).

## 🛣️ The 3 Themes

## 👩‍💻 Just tell me what to do ... after this 3 months... for the next days, weeks, months ... even years

Before to deep dive into the Javascript Ecosystem, **build a strong language understanding foundation**.
If you are ready to learn, the following links in this post [How to Learn ES6](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-learn-es6-47d9a1ac2620) are a good start.

For the new decade, take a look at some trends data with [Top JavaScript Frameworks and Tech Trends for 2021](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/top-javascript-frameworks-and-tech-trends-for-2021-d8cb0f7bda69).
Still valid for 2023.

Then you can **follow these awesome paths to become a Web developer**: [Developer Roadmaps - Step by step guides and paths to learn different tools or technologies](https://roadmap.sh/)

## 📱 Workshops

The workshops approach is **a comprehensive and actionable live sessions guide** through the different stages to bootstrap an online business with a web application.

We complete **1 project to solve a real-world problem** like to

1. 🚙 Check if a car sold on Leboncoin is a good deal
2. 👨🏽‍🍳 Find all TheFork deals for 3-stars Michelin restaurant
3. 🚘 Find SUV with the largest trunk
4. 🏰 List the best rates for Relais & Châteaux with starred restaurants
5. 🇫🇷 List Maître Restaurateur with Bib Gourmand distinction
6. ...
