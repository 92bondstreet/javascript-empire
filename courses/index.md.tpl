## 🎯 Objective

```
Be able to start an online business with a web application.
```

## 🎣 Methodology

Before each workshop, I share some collection of useful links to deep diving on the current subject split in 3 parts. I try to limit to 14 hours of work by week (2h by day, Monday to Sunday).

* **📖 Must Read**
* **🍿 Must Watch**
* **👩 Just tell me what to do**
* the 🚀 link. If you have just 30 minutes in your student busy life: **Read the 🚀 link**

### 📖 Must Read

Useful links to read as blog post or github link.

### 🍿 Must Watch

At least 1 talk or podcast link could help you to learn in a passive context (commuting for instance) or when you do something else (workout).

### 👩 Just tell me what to do

To be ready the workshop day, links to tutorials, exercises to do...
